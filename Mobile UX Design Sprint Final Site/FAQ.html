      <h2>Who to Bring</h2>
        <h3>How many people from my company should attend?</h3>
          <p>Ideally 3 or 4 people. (The minimum is 2 and the maximum is 5.)</p>
        <h3>Who are the right people?</h3>
          <p>Whoever you need in the room to make decisions and designs for the mobile web. That can include mobile designers and UX, mobile developers, product managers, or marketing.</p>
        <h3>Can we swap out attendees after registering?</h3>
          <p>Yes, no problem at all, just shoot us an email to let us know</p>
      <h2>What to work on</h2>
        <h3>What is an example of a good proejct to work on?</h3>
          <p>The focus of this sprint is improving your conversion flow. Many clients choose to work on optimization an application form or checkout process, while some work on the education and section portion. Either way, we suggest focusin gon either new users or upsells, not a logged in user expereicne</p>
        <h3>Can I work on my mobile app?</h3>
          <p>The content will be 100% focused on mobile web, so mobile app projects aren't a good fit for this event</p>
        <h3>We've already started a mobile re-design project, can we use that?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely! Just make sure you have a clear goal for what to accomplish during the sprint</p>
      <h2>Logistics</h2>
        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>Please bring an ID to check in and your laptop with whatever design software you'd like to use for prototyping. Otherwise we'll have everything you need, including chargers, paper/pens, food and drinks, etc.</p>
        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
          <p>We're pretty casual at Google so wear whatever you're comfortable in! (Jeans are usually a safe bet)</p>
        <h3>Will I have time to check email?</h3>
          <p>Most of the day we'll ask that you focus on the sprint, however you will get 45 minutes for lunch and multiple 5-10 minute breaks to check email</p>
      <h2>Misc</h2>
        <h3>What other companies will be there?</h3>
          <p>It depends, but typically you can expect between 5-7 other companies from various verticals</p>
        <h3>What if I don't feel comfortable sharing?</h3>
          <p>No problem at all! Only feel what you're comfortable with. Many clients get a lot of value from getting peer feedback, but if you'd 1:1 feedback with Googlers instead we can arrange that</p>
